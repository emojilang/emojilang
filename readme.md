# Emojilang

Emojilang is a based entirely in the standard set of Unicode emojis. 
It was developed by user [digigon](https://www.reddit.com/u/digigon) in November of 2016 and first appeared on the [conlangs](https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/5f8rzw/a_serious_emoji_conlang) subreddit.
Since, it has seen significant development on its own [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/emojilang) and [discord](https://discord.gg/WWaTn6u).

## Overview

**Emojilang is a topic-prominent pro-drop head-final language.**<br>
Anything that gets marked by whatever has its marker comes after it. 
The phrase "I speak Emojilang" would be semantically represented as *this person do*, *emoji speak*, *speak*.

**You can drop things that are understandable from context.**<br>
You can drop unimportant parts of a sentence, and abbreviation is common. 
Copulas are optional. 

**A single emoji has a primary function but may be used in other ways.**<br>
They may be nouns, verbs, attitudinals (using emoji like normal), and some others, but you can get a feel for how things are used by using them on the subreddit or discord.

**Emoji can always be compounded, with the primary character coming after.**<br>
This is how most vocabulary and special constructions are built.


**Sentences consist of adverbial phrases.**<br>
An adverbial phrase is always followed by a verb, such as ✊ for transitive subject, 📥 for target or entering, 📤 for exiting, ⏰ for time, ❓ to mark the topic, ❕ being to use other things adverbially, and others. Any sentence can be made into a subclause by adding ❗️ to the end. 

**Punctuation is standard and tied to speech.**<br>
Punctuation includes 〰️ to separate statements and 🔺🔻 for direct quotations.
